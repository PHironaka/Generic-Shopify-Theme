# Generic-Shopify-Theme
Custom Shopify Theme

## Overview
I wanted to build a default theme with limited design considerations so that it could be customized to an individual shops needs. I didn't create this with a specific theme in mind. Most of the features in the theme can be accessed and customized by the shop's Admin user.

## Features

## Universal
- SVG icons (social, placeholder logo, cart icon)

### Homepage
- Hero image with intro text and CTA button.
- Two column shop items
- Four column of latest items
